# Web Server Grading Sheet

*The TA will fill out this sheet when grading your program.*

<div class="border">
  Student Name:
</div>

**TA:** *Check the boxes below to indicate which tests pass
successfully.  Circle the boxes that do not work correctly and
include a written statement explaining the error that occured.*

## Basic Functionality
      
{{ item("HTML File and Embedded Images",10,"Use a web browser to
access the server and view the index.html file provided with the
assignment. The server should provide both the index file and the
embedded images. This should work for a URI that is either / or
/index.html.") }}

{{ item ("Large File",5,"Use a web browser to access the server and
download largefile.txt. The server should provide the entire file.")
}}

{{ item("PDF File",5,"Use a web browser to download
I-Have-A-Dream.pdf. The file should open properly in a PDF reader.")
}}

{{ item("Persistent Connection",10,"Use test script to verify that the
server uses a persistent TCP connection, allowing the client to fetch
multiple objects during one connection. The server should also timeout
an idle connection based on the timeout period given in the
configuration file.") }}

{{ item("Headers",10,"Use test script to check that the server always
returns a Date header with the correct date format and a Server header
identifying the name of the server. Check that the server includes a
valid Content-Length, Content-Type, and Last-Modified header.") }}

## Error Checking and Response Codes

{{ item("Server handles bind errors",2,"Start two servers with the
same port number and check whether a bind error is handled
gracefully.") }}

{{ item("400 Bad Request",2,"Use test script to check that the server
returns a 400 error and web page for the case when the client issues a
request with the method or URI empty.") }}

{{ item("403 Forbidden",2,"Use the test script to check that the
server returns a 403 error and web page when the client requests a
file with no read permissions.")  }}
      
{{ item("404 Not Found",2,"Use the test script to check that the
server returns a 404 error and web page when the client asks for a
file that does not exist.") }}

{{ item("501",2,"Use the test script to check that the server returns
a 501 error and web page when the client uses a method that does not
exist.") }}

## Architecture

{{ item("Non-Blocking I/O",30,"The TA will test your code to be
sure non-blocking I/O is done properly. This can be done by having
one client send a partial request, followed by a second client sending
a full request, followed by the rest of the first request.") }}

{{ item("Idle Socket Timeout",20,"The TA will test your code to be
sure idle sockets are timed out properly. This can be done with
telnet.") }}

{{ item("Load Test, Low Rate",25,"Use the stress test script to create
a steady stream of requests at a low rate (10 threads busy for 10
seconds). Your server should handle this load well.") }}

{{ item("Load Test, Moderate Rate",25,"Use the stress test script to
create a steady stream of requests a moderate rate (100 threads busy
for 10 seconds). Your server should handle this load well.") }}

## Extra Credit

{{ item("HEAD and Range Requests",15,"Make your web server work with
your download accelerator. This involves support HEAD requests and
Range requests. Using the '-e' flag on the test script checks this
functionality.") }}

  complete and then turn the sheet in to the professor.*
