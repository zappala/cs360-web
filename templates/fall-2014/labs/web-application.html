# Lab: Web Application

In this assignment, you will write a web database application.  The
goals of this assignment are to (1) learn how to design a model for a
database appliction, and (2) gain experience designing a user
interface for a web application, and (3) learn how to program a web
application using a modern framework.

## Passion

Work on something you are passionate about. This could be something
you always wanted to build, something that you think could lead to a
startup, or something that will help society in some way. For example,
my passions are family history work and civic hacking. You don’t need
to share my passions, but should find your own.

## Requirements

Your application must meet these general requirements:

* Has a back end that stores data in a relational (e.g. MySQL) or
document database (e.g. MongoDB).

* Has a front end that follows good [web design
principles](http://cs360.byu.edu/static/fall-2014/lectures/web-design.pdf).

* Supports a REST interface as an API that can be used for third-party
applications.

* Uses some kind of cutting-edge framework, or a framework you haven’t
used before. Good choices are:

    * Javascript: node.js and Express for the backend, with Angular
    for the front end

    * Python: Flask or DJango (in increasing level of complexity)

    * Ruby: Sinatra, Padrino, Rails (in increasing level of complexity)

    * PHP: Yii

    You will be highly productive using Flask since you know some
    Python already. I would also encourage you to try
    node/Angular, since these are rapidly becoming very popular
    and many jobs are available for them.

* Has the code stored in GitHub using the open source license of your
choice.

* The final project is hosted on a web site.

## Idea, Features, and Architecture.

Describe the idea for your application. This can be the same text in
your proposal. This should include:

* Your pitch. Explain what need this application meets. Why will anyone 
want to use it?

* A brief description of what your application will do to meet this need.

Describe the features of your application. This should include:

* All of the features you would ideally implement if you had the time
to create your ideal application.

* The list of features you will implement this semester. This could be
a minimal viable product, if you were going to market. Larger teams
should have more features.

Describe the architecture of your application. This includes the
technologies you will use for a database, a back-end server, and a
front end.  You may design a mobile application instead of or in
addition to a web site.

This report must be hosted on your GitHub Wiki.

Each group member must submit the URL of your GitHub Wiki page to get
credit.

## Interface Design

Draw the user interface for your program.  This includes every page on
the site. You can separately draw headers and footers if they are
consistent on every page.  Your drawings may be done with a computer
program or by hand, but should be of a quality you would be comfortable
showing to your supervisor at work.

Put these drawings onto a web page for your site. Explain how the user
will navigate through these pages.

This report must be hosted on your GitHub Wiki, even if it is just a link
to some other mockup site.

Each group member must submit the URL of your GitHub Wiki page to get
credit.

## Milestones

For each milestone, write a report detailing your overall team
progress in meeting your planned features. Put this in the GitHub
Wiki.

In addition, for each milestone, every group member writes an
individual report of his or her current progress. Explain what you
have accomplished so far and what features you helped to implement.

Submit a PDF of this report and include a link to your Wiki in the
Text submission area.

## Final Report

When you are finished with your application, write a report. Put this
on your GitHub Wiki. Include
the following:

* **Description**: Explain the purpose of the site and what
functionality you implemented. Include a few relevant screenshots
showing what the site can do, and write a short paragraph describing
each one.

* **Database Schema**: Describe how data is stored in your database.
If you used a relational database, show your entity-relationship
diagram that includes all entities, attributes, and relationships, and
explain what it contains.  You should use the standard
entity-relationship format as shown in class. Use a program to draw
this diagram, such as [lucidchart](http://www.lucidchart.com) or
[dia](http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia). If you used a document
database, show your JSON document structure and explain what it
contains.

* **Future Work**: Describe a roadmap for future development, with
additional features you could add or changes to the interface.

In addition, each group member should write an individual, separate
report, describing in detail the contributions he or she made to
the project.

Submit a PDF of your individual report and include a link to your Wiki
in the Text submission area.

## Final Submission

When finished with your final project, submit the URL where your
application is hosted, along with any login information needed for an
administrative user, and any other information needed for evaluating
the application

On this site, be sure there is a URL for your GitHub code and a URL for
the Wiki or other pages where the additional reports are hosted.

## Grading

This assignment is worth 250 points, using the following scale:

* Idea and Features: 20 points. Judged based on
completeness.

* Interface Design: 20 points. Initial design of the application. Judged
on usability.

* Milestone #1: 30 points. Judged based on progress and effort.

* Report: 30 points. Judged based on the clarity and quality of your
report.

* Utility of the application: 100 points. Judged based on the features
completed, how useful this site would be to your target audience. The
size of your group will be taken into consideration.

* Design of the application: 50 points. Judged based on the overall
design, how well it follows web design principles and practice. We
will evaluate your front page experience in addition to the
application itself.
