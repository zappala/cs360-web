# Lab: Queueing Theory and Web Server Performance

In this assignment, you will use queuing theory and experiments to
examine the performance of your web server.  The goals of this
assignment are to (1) learn how to apply queueing theory to the study
of a networked system, (2) to learn how to use experiments to study
the performance of a networked system, and (3) to gain experience with
the scientific method when running experiments, collecting data, and
analyzing results.

For this assignment, you will be writing a report, rather than turning
in code.  The report will consist of three parts: (1) basic queueing
theory, (2) queueing theory analysis of an open source web server and
your web server, and (3) experimental performance evaluation of an
open source web server and your web server.

## 1. Queuing Theory

For the first part of your report, answer the following
questions. Show all of your work. You are welcome to use a calculator
or write a Python script to do the calculations.

1. You are entering the Marriott Center to watch a basketball game.
There is only one ticket line to purchase tickets.  Each ticket
purchase takes an average of 18 seconds. The average arrival rate is 3
persons/minute. Find the average length of queue and average waiting
time in queue assuming M/M/1 queuing.

1. You are now in line to get into the arena.  There are 3 operating
turnstiles with one ticket-taker each.  On average it takes 3 seconds
for a ticket-taker to process your ticket and allow entry. The average
arrival rate is 40 persons/minute.

    Find the average length of queue, average waiting time in queue
    assuming M/M/N queuing. What is the probability of having exactly
    5 people in the system?
	  
1. You are now inside the arena.  They are passing out Cosmo the
Cougar bobblehead dolls as a free giveaway.  There is only one person
passing these out and a line has formed behind her.  It takes her
exactly 6 seconds to hand out a doll and the arrival rate averages 9
people/minute.

    Find the average length of queue, average waiting time in queue,
    and average time spent in the system assuming M/D/1 queuing.

## 2. Queueing Analysis

### Lighttpd

Install the lighttpd web server:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install lighttpd
</pre>

or on the lab machines:

<pre>
wget http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/releases-1.4.x/lighttpd-1.4.28.tar.gz
tar -xf lighttpd-1.4.28.tar.gz
cd lighttpd-1.4.28
./configure --prefix=$HOME
make
make install
</pre>

The server binaries will be installed in ~/sbin and the libraries will
be in ~/lib.

See this
[configuration tutorial](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/TutorialConfiguration)
to learn how to configure lighttpd to serve files.

To run the server:

<pre>
sudo service lighttpd start
</pre>

or on the lab machines

<pre>
cd ~/sbin
~/sbin/lighttpd -f lighttpd.conf -m ~/lib
</pre>

### Analysis

Measure the average response time for both lighttpd and your own web
server. You can do this by writing a small Python script that measures
how long it takes for the server to handle a single request.  Do this
100 times in a row and take the average.

Because you are sending one response at a time, this test eliminates
any queueing delay and gives you a measure of the average service rate
(the number of requests your server can handle per second).  Using
this value, graph the theoretical average response time as a function
of utilization for each of the two servers. The average response time
is equivalent to the average time in the system for an M/M/1
queue.

### Report

For this part of the report, explain your methodology (how you
collected the data on service rate for the two web servers), show your
graphs, and discuss what they show.

You should clone the [Web Server
Testing](https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing) GitHub
repository to get access to the scripts and data for testing.

## 3. Performance Evaluation

Run performance measurements on your web server using this
[workload generator]("https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/blob/master/tests/generator.py") written in Python.

### Syntax

Call the workload generator using the following syntax:

<pre>
python generator.py --server [host] --port [port] -l [load] -d [duration]
</pre>

where:

<pre>
[host]     -- the hostname where your server is running (default localhost)
[port]     -- the port your server is listening on (default 80)
[load]     -- the average load in clients per second (default 1)
[duration] -- the duration of the test in seconds (default 1)
</pre>

For example:

<pre>
python generator.py --port 8000 -l 10 -d 30
</pre>

will generate 10 clients per second, for 30 seconds, accessing the web
server on localhost at port 8000.

### Web Server Configuration

The generator will make requests for a set of 1000 files
stored in the root directory configured for your web server.
	
Use the files in the [www
directory](https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/tree/master/www)
for load testing.  Use this
[web.conf](https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/blob/master/tests/web.conf)
configuration file, which sets _default_ to use the www
directory, assuming your web server handles relative paths
properly.

### How The Generator Works

The workload generator creates sessions that access the web server;
each session represents one user downloading one object from the web
server. The number of sessions the generator creates is determined by
the load parameter you supply. The load is an average of an
exponential distribution, given in units of sessions per second. The
generator will continually spawn threads, one per session, at the rate
given by the load parameter, for the duration specified.

Each time a session starts, it chooses a file to download from the
server, named /file000.txt to /file999.txt. The session chooses a file
from a Zipf popularity matrix, with alpha equal to 1. The sizes of the
1000 files are generated by the
[files.py](https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/blob/master/tests/files.py)
Python script, which uses a Pareto distribution with alpha equal to 3
and beta equal to 5 KB (5120 bytes).

### Output

When the script runs, each session generates output with the format:

<pre>
[sessionID] [URI] [status] [bytes] [seconds]
</pre>

where:

* [sessionID] is a unique identifier for the session
* [URI] is the URI of the file downloaded
* [status] is the status phrase returned by the server
* [bytes] is the number of bytes downloaded
* [seconds] is the time it took to download the URI, in seconds

### Experiments

Run a set of experiments using the workload generator on both your web
server and lighttpd.  See if you can get the same result as the
theoretical graph you created in part 2.

1. Setup your web server and lighttpd so that they are running
on the same machine. Run the workload generator.

2. Using the workload generator, run separate experiments with ten
different loads on both your web server and lighttpd.  Use loads that
are spread across different regions of the graph from part 2.  Have
each experiment last 30 seconds.

3. Collect the output of each experiment into a separate file.  Be
sure to name them properly, e.g. web-[server]-[load].txt, where
[server] is the name of the server, and [load] is the load used.

### Analysis

Using the data you collect, write a Python script to create a box plot
of the response time as a function of utilization.  On the same graph,
plot the theoretical line from Part 2.

When creating graphs, do not use any data that includes errors, for
example a connection timed out or socket errors.  Use load levels for
which there are no errors.

### Report

For this part of the report, explain your methodology (how you ran the
experiments and collected data), show your graphs, and discuss what
they show. Be sure to refer to the graphs in your report, for example
"Figure 1 shows that ..."  Explain how well the experiments match the
theoetical results, and discuss any differences you see.  Discuss the
difference in performance between the two servers.

## 4. Conclusion

Write a one or two paragraph conclusion, explaining what you have
learned and what you could do in the future to explore this topic
further.</p>

## Extra Credit

For extra credit, include the same comparision for the
[nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) web server. You may alternatively
use nginx for Part 2 and then use lighttpd as extra credit.

## Submission

Submit a PDF of your report using [learningsuite.byu.edu](http://learningsuite.byu.edu).

## Grading

The report for this assignment is worth 150 points, using the
following scale:

* Theory: 30 points
* Analysis: 30 points
* Experiments: 60 points
* Overall Clarity of Report: 30 points
* Extra Credit: 15 points

Be sure to use a clear, scientific style. Each paragraph should begin
with a topic sentence, and the remaining sentences should support this
topic. Use "we" and not "I". Use the active voice, e.g. "Figure 1
shows...". Label each figure and refer to the figure by number when
discussing your results. Be sure all graphs have accurate labels.
