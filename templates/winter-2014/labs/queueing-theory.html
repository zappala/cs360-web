      <h1>Lab: Queueing Theory and Web Server Performance</h1>

      <p>In this assignment, you will use queuing theory and experiments to
	examine the performance of your web server.  The goals of this
	assignment are to (1) learn how to apply queueing theory to the study
	of a networked system, (2) to learn how to use experiments to study
	the performance of a networked system, and (3) to gain experience with
	the scientific method when running experiments, collecting data, and
	analyzing results.</p>

      <p>For this assignment, you will be writing a report, rather than
	turning in code.  The report will consist of three parts: (1) basic
	queueing theory, (2) queueing theory analysis of an open source web
	server and your web server, and (3) experimental performance
	evaluation of an open source web server and your web server.</p>

      <h2>1. Queuing Theory</h2>

      <p>For the first part of your report, answer the following
	questions. Show all of your work. You are welcome to use a calculator
	or write a Python script to do the calculations.</p>

      <ol>

	<li>You are entering the Marriott Center to watch a basketball game.
	  There is only one ticket line to purchase tickets.  Each ticket
	  purchase takes an average of 18 seconds. The average arrival rate is 3
	  persons/minute.
	  
	  <p>Find the average length of queue and average waiting time in queue
	    assuming M/M/1 queuing.</p>

	</li>

	<li>You are now in line to get into the arena.  There are 3 operating
	  turnstiles with one ticket-taker each.  On average it takes 3 seconds
	  for a ticket-taker to process your ticket and allow entry. The average
	  arrival rate is 40 persons/minute.

	  <p>Find the average length of queue, average waiting time in queue
	    assuming M/M/N queuing.</p>

	  <p>What is the probability of having exactly 5 people in the system?</p>
	  
	</li>

	<li>You are now inside the arena.  They are passing out Cosmo the
	  Cougar bobblehead dolls as a free giveaway.  There is only one person
	  passing these out and a line has formed behind her.  It takes her
	  exactly 6 seconds to hand out a doll and the arrival rate averages 9
	  people/minute.

	  <p>Find the average length of queue, average waiting time in queue,
	    and average time spent in the system assuming M/D/1 queuing.</p>

	</li>

      </ol>

      <h2>2. Queueing Analysis</h2>

      <h3>Lighttpd</h3>

      <p>Install the lighttpd web server:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install lighttpd
</pre>

      or on the lab machines:

<pre>
wget http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/releases-1.4.x/lighttpd-1.4.28.tar.gz
tar -xf lighttpd-1.4.28.tar.gz
cd lighttpd-1.4.28
./configure --prefix=$HOME
make
make install
</pre>

      <p>The server binaries will be installed in ~/sbin and the libraries
	will be in ~/lib.</p>

      <p>See this

	<a href="http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/TutorialConfiguration">configuration tutorial</a>

	to learn how to configure lighttpd to serve files.</p>

      <p>To run the server:</p>

<pre>
sudo service lighttpd start
</pre>

      or on the lab machines

<pre>
cd ~/sbin
~/sbin/lighttpd -f lighttpd.conf -m ~/lib
</pre>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>

      <p>Measure the average response time for both lighttpd and your own web server. You can do this
	by writing a small Python script that measures how long it takes for the server to handle a single request.
	Do this 100 times in a row and take the average.</p>

      <p>Because you are sending one response at a time, this test
	eliminates any queueing delay and gives you a measure of the average
	service rate (the number of requests your server can handle per
	second).  Using this value, graph the theoretical average response
	time as a function of utilization for each of the two servers. The
	average response time is equivalent to the average time in the system
	for an M/M/1 queue.</p>

      <h3>Report</h3>

      <p>For this part of the report, explain your methodology (how you
	collected the data on service rate for the two web servers), show your
	graphs, and discuss what they show.</p>

      <p>You should clone
	the <a href="https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing">Web
	Server Testing</a> GitHub repository to get access to the
	scripts and data for testing.</p>

      <h2>3. Performance Evaluation</h2>

      <p>Run performance measurements on your web server using this

	<a href="https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/blob/master/tests/generator.py">workload
	generator</a>

	written in Python.</p>

      <h3>Syntax</h3>

      <p>Call the workload generator using the following syntax:</p>

<pre>
python generator.py --server [host] --port [port] -l [load] -d [duration]
</pre>

      <p>where:</p>

<pre>
[host]     -- the hostname where your server is running (default localhost)
[port]     -- the port your server is listening on (default 80)
[load]     -- the average load in clients per second (default 1)
[duration] -- the duration of the test in seconds (default 1)
</pre>

      <p>For example:</p>

<pre>
python generator.py --port 8000 -l 10 -d 30
</pre>

      <p>will generate 10 clients per second, for 30 seconds, accessing
	the web server on localhost at port 8000.</p>

      <h3>Web Server Configuration</h3>

      <p>The generator will make requests for a set of 1000 files
	stored in the root directory configured for your web server.
	
	Use the files in
	the <a href="https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/tree/master/www">www
	directory</a> for load testing. Use
	this <a href="https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/blob/master/tests/web.conf">web.conf</a>
	configuration file, which sets <u>default</u> to use the www
	directory, assuming your web server handles relative paths
	properly.</p>

      <h3>How The Generator Works</h3>

      <p>The workload generator creates sessions that access the web server;
	each session represents one user downloading one object from the web
	server. The number of sessions the generator creates is determined by
	the load parameter you supply. The load is an average of an
	exponential distribution, given in units of sessions per second. The
	generator will continually spawn threads, one per session, at the rate
	given by the load parameter, for the duration specified.</p>

      <p>Each time a session starts, it chooses a file to download from the
	server, named /file000.txt to /file999.txt. The session chooses a file
	from a Zipf popularity matrix, with alpha equal to 1. The sizes of the
	1000 files are generated by the

	<a href="https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/blob/master/tests/files.py">files.py</a>

	Python script, which uses a Pareto distribution with alpha equal to 3
	and beta equal to 5 KB (5120 bytes).</p>

      <h3>Output</h3>

      <p>When the script runs, each session generates output with the format:</p>

<pre>
[sessionID] [URI] [status] [bytes] [seconds]
</pre>

      <p>where:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>[sessionID] is a unique identifier for the session</li>
	<li>[URI] is the URI of the file downloaded</li>
	<li>[status] is the status phrase returned by the server</li>
	<li>[bytes] is the number of bytes downloaded</li>
	<li>[seconds] is the time it took to download the URI, in seconds</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Experiments</h3>

      <p>Run a set of experiments using the workload generator on both your
	web server and lighttpd.  See if you can get the same result as
	the theoretical graph you created in part 2.</p>

      <ol>

	<li>Setup your web server and lighttpd so that they are running
	  on the same machine. Run the workload generator.</li>

	<li>Using the workload generator, run separate experiments with ten
	  different loads on both your web server and lighttpd.  Use
	  loads that are spread across different regions of the graph from part
	  2.  Have each experiment last 30 seconds.</li>

	<li>Collect the output of each experiment into a separate file.  Be
	  sure to name them properly, e.g. web-[server]-[load].txt, where
	  [server] is the name of the server, and [load] is the load used.</li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>

      <p>Using the data you collect, write a Python script to create a
	box plot of the response time as a function of utilization.
	On the same graph, plot the theoretical line from Part 2.</p>

      <p>When creating graphs, do not use any data that includes errors, for
	example a connection timed out or socket errors.  Use load levels for
	which there are no errors.</p>

      <h3>Report</h3>

      <p>For this part of the report, explain your methodology (how you ran
	the experiments and collected data), show your graphs, and discuss
	what they show. Be sure to refer to the graphs in your report, for
	example "Figure 1 shows that ..."  Explain how well the experiments
	match the theoretical results, and discuss any differences you see.
	Discuss the difference in performance between the two servers.</p>

      <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>

      <p>Write a one or two paragraph conclusion, explaining what you have
	learned and what you could do in the future to explore this topic
	further.</p>

      <h2>Extra Credit</h2>

      <p>For extra credit, include the same comparision for
      the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a> web server.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>

      <p>Submit a PDF of your report using
	<a href="http://learningsuite.byu.edu">learningsuite.byu.edu</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Grading</h2>

      <p>The report for this assignment is worth 150 points, using the
	following scale:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Theory: 30 points</li>
	<li>Analysis: 30 points</li>
	<li>Experiments: 60 points</li>
	<li>Overall Clarity of Report: 30 points</li>
	<li>Extra Credit: 15 points</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Be sure to use a clear, scientific style. Each paragraph
      should begin with a topic sentence, and the remaining sentences
      should support this topic. Use "we" and not "I". Use the active
      voice, e.g. "Figure 1 shows...". Label each figure and refer to
      the figure by number when discussing your results. Be sure all
      graphs have accurate labels.</p>
