# Lab: Web Server

The goals of this assignment are (1) to understand how to create an
event-driven server and (2) to use POSIX system calls for the file
system and time.

In this assignment, you will write a web server in Python that
implements some of the HTTP 1.1 specification given in [RFC
2616](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html).  You will implement
enough of HTTP to demonstrate that you can write a substantial server
application and understand fundamental POSIX system calls.  In
addition, you will use a scalable event-driven server architecture.

## Event-Driven Server Architecture

An event-driven web server uses the `epoll` interface to manage a set
of sockets in a single thread.  `epoll` allows your server to go to
sleep until a socket I/O event occurs, then wakes the server up with a
list of sockets that have I/O events ready. The server loops through
these sockets and handles them one at a time.  The echo server code in
this [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/zappala/python-networking-and-threading)
shows you how to use `epoll`.

When handling sockets with this architecture, you should configure
each client to use non-blocking socket I/O. Then the server should
call recv() once for that client. Your server should handle all
messages that are available, cache any remainder, and then move on to
the next client.  The server must maintain a separate message cache
for each socket to store partial messages.  Be sure to check for a
closed socket and for the EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK errors.

Implement your server so that it times out any sockets that have been
idle for a given period of time, using a mark-and-sweep
algorithm. With this algorithm, you should keep track of the last time
each client socket had an input event (the mark). Then, once every
half second, loop through all the sockets and close any that have been
idle for too long. A parameter in the configuration file gives the
maximum idle time.

The server must be implemented using the low level socket routines in
the Python socket library, which provide a Python style interface to
the BSD socket API.

Your web server is required to use `epoll` with non-blocking I/O on
both the server and the client sockets, as shown in the sample code.
Any lab turned in without this will earn zero points.

You may use the
[http-parser](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/http-parser) library to
simplify HTTP parsing.  You can install it with pip. A short example
is shown below. The help on this library is sparse so if you want any
other functionality you will need to look at the source for the
library.

<pre><code class="python">try:
    from http_parser.parser import HttpParser
except ImportError:
    from http_parser.pyparser import HttpParser

p = HttpParser()
nparsed = p.execute(message,len(message))
print p.get_method(),p.get_path(),p.get_headers()
</code></pre>

## Server Functionality

Your web server should handle the following portions of the HTTP 1.1
specification.

### Methods

Your server should implement the GET method.  Because it uses HTTP
1.1, your server should support multiple requests on one TCP
connection and multiple hosts on one web server.

If the URI given is `/` your server should default to serving
`/index.html`.

### Headers

You should implement the following headers:

* General Headers
    * Date
* Response Headers
    * Server
* Entity Headers
    * Content-Type
    * Content-Length
    * Last-Modified


Both the Date and Last-Modified headers should use RFC 822 / RFC 1123
format dates. Your server can determine the Content-Type of a file
using its extension, based on the configuration file discussed below.
Note that your server should be able to parse any headers not listed
and ignore them.

### Response Codes

You should implement the following response codes and use them as
appropriate:

* 200 OK

* 400 Bad Request : if the web server parses the request and the
method or URI is empty

* 403 Forbidden: if the web server does not have permission to open
the requested file

* 404 Not Found: if the web server cannot find the requested file

* 500 Internal Server Error: if the web server encounters any other
error when trying to open a file

* 501 Not Implemented: if the web server does not implement the
requested method

All responses should include an entity body (the file being sent),
even errors. The entity body in an error response allows the browser
to display an error to the user.

### Extra Credit

For extra credit, you can make your web server work with the download
accelerator from the previous lab. This requires supporting HEAD
requests and Range requests.

## Web Server Configuration

Your web server should be configured by reading in a file called
*web.conf*.  This file will determine where resources are located and
what types of files the server supports.  The configuration file can
contain multiple lines, with each line following one of the following
formats:

<pre>
host [name] [path]
media [ext] [type]
parameter [name] [value]
</pre>

An example configuration file could contain:

<pre>
host default web

media txt text/plain
media html text/html
media jpg image/jpeg
media gif image/gif
media png image/png
media pdf application/pdf

parameter timeout 1
</pre>

A host line tells the server where the document root is located for a
given host.  The host can be `default`, or a hostname such as
`localhost` or `amazon.com`. The path can be either relative such as
`web` or absolute like `/tmp/web`.  A relative path starts in the
current directory, whereas an absolute path starts in the root
directory. The keyword `default` gives the path for any other host not
listed in the configuration file. We will only test default entries.

A media line tells the server the MIME type to use in the Content-Type
header for a document that ends in the given extension.  If a document
has no extension, or if its extension is not listed in the
configuration file, then your server should treat it as a text/plain
file.

The parameter line tells the server the time, in seconds, that a
socket is allowed to be idle before it will be closed.

When you start your web server, you should parse this configuration
file.

## Command Line Arguments and Error Checking

Your server should be called `web.py` and must take the following
arguments:

<pre>
-p [port]
-d
</pre>

The port argument gives the port the web server should bind to, by
default 8080.  The debug flag turns debugging on for your server.

You should check for errors for all system calls and exit gracefully
if an error occurs, printing out an appropriate error message.

## Testing

To test your web server, use the files located in the [Web Server
Testing](https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing) GitHub
repository. Be sure to change the permissions of the file `test.txt`
so you get a 403 code when accessing it:

<pre>
chmod ugo-rwx static/files/test.txt
</pre>

### Protocol Testing

Use the `protocol.py` script to test your server to be sure it handles
the HTTP protocol properly, as well as partial data and non-blocking
I/O.

<pre>
python protocol.py -p 8080
</pre>

### Stress Testing

Use the
[stress.py](https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing/blob/master/tests/stress-test.py)
Python script in the same GitHub repository to test how your web
server responds to different levels of load. For example:

<pre>
python stress-test.py localhost:8000/static/files/largefile.txt -t 10 -d 10
</pre>

will keep 10 threads active for 10 seconds. Each thread will
constantly download the URL given on the command line

## Experiments

To run experiments on your web server install the
[tsung](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/) load testing tool:

<pre>
sudo dnf install tsung

sudo apt-get install tsung
</pre>

In the same [Web Server
Testing](https://github.com/zappala/web-server-testing) GitHub
repository, the directory `tsung` contains three scripts to run load tests. Start
with `200.xml`, which generates a load of 200 clients/second for 100
seconds, with each client requesting `index.html`:

<pre>
tsung -f 200.xml start
</pre>

This will create a log file in
`~/.tsung/log/YYYYMMDD-HHMM/tsung.log`. Now generate some graphs:

<pre>
mkdir 200
cd 200
tsung_stats --stats ~/.tsung/log/20161112-1328/tsung.log
</pre>

Be sure to use the path to the log file for your experiment, it will
be different than the example above.  Now you can view a set of graphs
with a browser:

<pre>
google-chrome graph.html
</pre>

Run the experiments for:

* `200.xml`: 200 clients/second `400.xml`: 400 clients/second
* `increasing.xml`: 100 to 550 clients/seconds

## nginx

Install nginx and configure it to use the same files. Here is my
configuration:

<pre>
server {

    listen 80;
    root /var/www/zappala/;
    index index.html index.htm;

    server_name zappala.dev;
    }
</pre>

Note, I also have the following in /etc/hosts:

<pre>
127.0.0.1 zappala.dev
</pre>

Run the same experiments on nginx that you ran on your server. You will need
to update the XML files to point to the correct hostname and port where you are running
nginx.

## Report

Write a report that compares the performance of your server with nginx:

1. Graphs for your server.

    Make a section heading: `200 requests/second`. Under this heading,
    show the graphs titled `Mean transaction and page duration`,
    `Transaction and page rate`, `Request and TCP/UDP connection
    rate`, and `HTTP code response rate` for the first experiment at
    200 requests/second. Tile these graphs so that there are two per
    column and two per row.

    Repeat this for all your graphs, using section headings of `400
    requests/second` and `Increasing load`.

2. Graphs for nginx.

   Repeat the above for nginx.

3. Write a paragraph or two analyzing your results How well does your server
   handle these loads? How well does your server compare with nginx?

## Submission

Create a tgz of your program directory. Please include a `web.conf` that
uses default for a hostname, all of the testing files from GitHub, and
the test scripts from GitHub. This will allow the TA to test your code
immediately, rather than having to download or configure anything.

For example, if your code is in the
directory called web-server, then you would type this:

<pre>
tar -czvf web-server.tgz web-server
</pre>

Submit your tgz file using [learningsuite.byu.edu](http://learningsuite.byu.edu).

## Grading


Your web server will be tested as specified in the [grading
sheet]({{url_for("show",directory="fall-2016/labs",page="web-server-grading")}}).

If you wish to receive help with your code, then you should print out
clear and concise debugging information when the debugging flag is
given on the command line. The more helpful and clear your debugging
information is, the better your chances for getting useful help. You
should apply this same standard to how you document your code.
