# Lab: Messaging Service

The goals of this lab are (1) to learn how to write a client-server
application using the BSD socket API, (2) to understand how to process
and parse data when reading from a network socket, and (3) to
understand how to implement a protocol.

In this assignment, you will create a server that can store and
retrieve messages for people.  You will also create a client that
users can use to send and read messages.

Your code must be written in C++.

## Messaging Protocol

The messaging protocol defines the communication between the client
and the server.  Protocol fields are separated by whitespace and lines
are ended by the newline character (\n).

### Storing Messages

<pre>
<b>Request</b>
put [name] [subject] [length]\n[message]

<b>Responses</b>
OK\n
error [description]\n
</pre>

The *put* request asks the server to store a message for a user
identified by [name].  The request consists of a [subject] and
[length] characters.  The [message] comes after the newline. The
[length] is the number of characters in the message and does not
include the newline or any of the characters before it. The server
returns the *OK* response if the message is stored successfully.
Otherwise, the server returns the *error* response, including a
descriptive message explaining the error.

Messages are stored in memory and are not written to disk. This means
that multiple clients can connect over time and read all messages
stored on the server, but once the server quits all messages are lost.

### Listing Messages

<pre>
<b>Request</b>
list [name]\n

<b>Responses</b>
list [number]\n[index] [subject]\n...[index] [subject]\n
error [description]\n
</pre>

The *list* request gets a list of messages for a user identified by
[name].  The server returns the *list* response if the query is
formatted properly.  The [number] returned may be zero if no messages
are stored for that user.  The subsequent lines list a numeric [index]
and the associated [subject] for each message stored for the user.
Otherwise, the server returns the *error* response, including a
descriptive message explaining the error. The [index] should count
starting at 1 and should be unique for each user.

### Retrieving Messages

<pre>
<b>Request</b>
get [name] [index]\n

<b>Responses</b>
message [subject] [length]\n[message]
error [description]\n
</pre>

The *get* request gets a message given by [index] for a user
identified by [name].  The server returns the *message* response if
the query is formatted properly and a message with the given index
exists for the listed user.  The message consists of a [subject] and
[length] characters.  The entire message comes after the newline
character.  The [length] is the number of characters in the message
and does not include the newline or any of the characters before
it. Otherwise, the server returns the *error* response, including a
descriptive message explaining the error.

### Reset

<pre>
<b>Request</b>
reset\n

<b>Responses</b>
OK\n
</pre>

The *reset* request removes all stored messages for all users. This is
used for testing purposes.

## Server

The messaging server implements the server side of the messaging
protocol and handles one client at a time.  It is
singly-threaded. Once connected, a client should be able to issue as
many commands as it wants, and the server will only close the
connection if the client closes it first. You are welcome to use the
echo server distributed on the class web site as a starting point.

## Client User Interface

The messaging client performs two functions: it implements the client
side of the messaging protocol and it provides a user
interface. <u>The user interface is not identical to the messaging
protocol.</u> The user interface defines what the user sees, which
hides some of the detail of the underlying protocol.

The user interface for the client should look exactly as shown below.
The interface provides a prompt of the form "% " (percent sign and a
space) and supports the following commands:

### Send Command

<pre>
% send [user] [subject]
- Type your message. End with a blank line -
[message]
...
[message]
[blank line]
% 
</pre>

This allows the user to store a [message] for the identified [user]
with the given [subject].  The user types the first line shown, and
the client responds with the instructions to type a message. The user
then types the rest of the message and ends with a blank line. Once
the use finishes, the client formats a *put* request, sends it to the
server, and waits for a response. The client should only print a
response from the server if it returns an error. The client shows the
prompt when it is done.

### List Command

<pre>
% list [user]
[index] [subject]
...
[index] [subject]
% 
</pre>

This allows the user to list all the messages for [user].  The user
types the first line shown. The client formats a *list* request, sends
it to the server, and waits for a response.  The client should print
the list of indexes and subjects, or an error message. The [index]
should start counting at 1 and should be unique for each user.

### Read Command

<pre>
% read [user] [index]
[subject]
[message]
% 
</pre>

This reads the message at [index] for the identified [user].  The
user types the first line shown. The client formats a *get* request,
sends it to the server, and waits for a response. The client should
print the subject and the message retrieved, or an error message.

### Quit Command

<pre>
% quit
</pre>

This quits the program.

## Command Line Arguments

The messaging server should be called <i>msgd</i> and take the
following arguments:

<pre>
Argument           Definition
---------------------------------------------------------
-p [port]          port number of the messaging server
-d                 print debugging information
</pre>


The port number is required; it indicates the port your server will
bind on.  You may code a default value for this option so that you do
not have to type it every time when you test your code.

The messaging client should be called <i>msg</i> and take the
following arguments:

<pre>
Argument           Definition
---------------------------------------------------------
-s [server]        machine name of the messaging server (e.g. hiking.cs.byu.edu)
-p [port]          port number of the messaging server
-d                 print debugging information
</pre>

The user must specify the server and port options so that the client
can connect to the instant messaging server.  You may code a default
value for these options so that you do not have to type them every
time when you test your code.

For both the client and server, the user may also specify a debugging
flag.  In this case, you should print out any helpful debugging
information you want, but you should never print debugging lines if
the flag is not specified on the command line.

You should use the *getopt* API for parsing the command line options;
see *man 3 getopt*.  This is a powerful parser that is easy to use and
enables many of the standard command-line behaviors that are familiar
to Linux users.

## Getting Started

### Use the Python version

Start by cloning the [Python messaging
service](https://github.com/zappala/messaging-service-python) Git
repository. This provides an example of the lab written in Python and
a testing script. You can run the server with:

<pre>
python messageDaemon.py
</pre>

Using a separate terminal, run the client with:

<pre>
python messageClient.py
</pre>

### Write a C++ client to talk to the Python server

Once you understand how the messaging system is supposed to work, write
your own client in C++ and use it to communicate with the Python server.
This will give you experience using the socket interface, parsing strings,
and writing a network protocol. Your client interface should work exactly
the same as the Python client.

As you write your code, use the [socket programming examples in
C++](https://github.com/zappala/socket-programming-examples-c) as a
starting point. You can freely use all this code. I recommend starting
with the client and server in the `echo` folder. For string parsing,
you can use [istringstream](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/istringstream/) or methods in the [string library](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/).

### Write a C++ server to talk to the Python and C++ clients

Once you have a client working, write you own server. It should work
with both your own client and the Python client. If all of these
interoperate, then you can be confident you have the protocol working
correctly. As a last step, use the python `messageTest.py` script to
test your server and use the [grading
sheet]({{url_for("show",directory="fall-2016/labs",page="messaging-service-grading")}})
to be sure you have implemented everything correctly.

## Debugging Network Protocols

If you are having difficulty with a client talking to a server, or
getting your server to pass the test driver, then you likely have an
error in your protocol. For example, a common error is for the client
to add a "\n" at the end of the put message, or for the server to
expect a "\n" at the end of the put message, when these are not part
of the protocol.

To debug a network protocol, I strongly advise putting a print
statement after every call to `recv()` and another one before every
call to `send()`. On the client, this will help you to see exactly
what is being sent to the server and what response you get. On the
server, this will help you see exactly what is received from the
client and what you sent in response. Examining this output should
help you to see any errors in your implementation of a protocol.

## Submission

Put all of your code into a single directory. Be sure to create a tar
file of your code, not a zip file. Be sure the tar file creates the
directory when it is untarred, and doesn't put all of the files in the
current directory. Follow the instructions below.

* Create a tgz of your program directory.  Remove any binaries and
send only the source code and your Makefile.  For example, if your
code is in the directory called lab1, then you would type this:

<pre>
cd lab1
make realclean
cd ..
tar -czvf lab1.tgz lab1
</pre>

* Submit the tgz file using
[learningsuite.byu.edu](http://learningsuite.byu.edu)

## Grading

Your lab will be tested as specified in the [grading
sheet]({{url_for("show",directory="fall-2016/labs",page="messaging-service-grading")}}).

As a part of testing, we will use the [Python testing
script](https://github.com/zappala/messaging-service-python) posted at
GitHub.

If you wish to receive help with your code, then you should print out
clear and concise debugging information when the debugging flag is
given on the command line. The more helpful and clear your debugging
information is, the better your chances for getting useful help. You
should apply this same standard to how you document your code.
