# Homework: Python Threading

In this assignment, you will become familiar with threading in Python.

## Getting the Headlines

This part of the homework will show you the Python
[Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library.

In your virtual environment, install Beautiful Soup:

<pre><code>
    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install beautifulsoup4
</code></pre>

Use the web server setup from your previous homework. Add a new link
in `index.html` called `Headlines` that executes a script
called `htbin/headlines.py`. Create this script and include the following:

~~~
#!/usr/bin/env python

import bs4
import random
import requests

print "Content-type: text/html"
print
print "<h1>Headlines</h1>"

news = requests.get("http://news.google.com").content
soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(news, 'html.parser')
for headline in soup.find_all('h2',{"class" :"esc-lead-article-title"}):
    print headline
~~~

Run this script from your web server to verify that it works.

## Fetching in Parallel

Use the web server setup from your previous homework. Add a new link
in `index.html` called `Headlines and Twitter Trends`.

In this script, create two threads. The first thread should fetch and
parse the news headlines from Google, using simlar code from the
previous homework. The second thread should fetch and show the tweets
from `https://twitter.com/whatstrending`. In the second thread, show
all the `p` tags that use the `tweet-text` class. Both of the threads
should store the relevant content in a local variable called
`content`.  Note, this should be a list.

The body of your Python script should create these two threads, start
them, and join them. When both threads are finished, use the `content`
variable to get the content that each thread has fetched. Display this
content in two side-by-side columns. You can do this with `<div>`
tags, one that floats right and the other that floats left. Each `<div>`
should have a width of 45%.

## Homework Assignment

1. Do all the above.

1. In class, demonstrate that your program works and show how you created threads.

1. Compare your code to others in the class.
