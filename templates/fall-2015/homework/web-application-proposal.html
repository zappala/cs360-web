# Homework: Web Application Proposal

For the final lab, you will write a web database application. You may
do this in groups of two to four students. This assignment will help
you formulate a proposal and create a group.

## Requirements

Your application must meet these general requirements:

* Have a back end that stores data in MongoDB

* Support an authenticated REST interface as an API for the back end

* Have a front end that follows good [web design principles](http://cs360.byu.edu/static/lectures/winter-2014/web-design.pdf).

I encourage you to build something that benefits society in some way,
in keeping with the mission of BYU. A good way to start is to choose
something that you are passionate about. For example, my passions are
family history work and civic hacking. Try to find what motivates you.

In addition, you must:

* Have the code stored in GitHub using the open source license of your
choice

* Host the final project on a web site. We'll share some details of
how to do this.

## Proposal

Visit [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1A4Vd2WMY3x5YrNb561u6un2W5UW1bUKaBKWMA_xrg/edit?usp=sharing)
to enter your idea, form a team, or join a team. All you need to enter is:

* Idea (one line)
* Motivation (one paragraph describing why this is a good idea)
* App (one paragraph describing app functionality)
* Team members (include emails)

Your team can be one to four people. I encourage you to join a group
-- many employers want you to experience situations where you have to
coordinate with other members and experience teams with different
skill levels.

The more people you have, the more functionality I expect. A single developer should
aim for an app that has enough functionality to demonstrate the viability of the idea.
Additional developers should provide additional features.

## Homework Assignment

1. Enter a proposal in the Google doc above, or join an existing proposal.

1. In class, finalize teams.
